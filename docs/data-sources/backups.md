# cockroach_backups (Data Source)

Information about backups stored on a specific cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Fetch the latest backup
data "cockroach_backups" "latest_backup" {
  cluster_id = cockroach_cluster.prod_cluster.id
  sort_order = "DESC"
  limit      = 1
}

# Get the id of the most recent backup
output "latest_backup_id" {
  value = data.cockroach_backups.latest_backup.backups[0].id
}

# Fetch backups within a specific date range
data "cockroach_backups" "backups_in_range" {
  cluster_id = cockroach_cluster.prod_cluster.id
  start_time = "2025-08-15"
  # List backups that occurred before 8/19/2025
  end_time   = "2025-08-19"
  sort_order = "DESC"
  limit      = 5
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_id` (String) The ID of the cluster containing the managed backups to be retrieved.

### Optional

- `end_time` (String) Ending timestamp of the range (exclusive) used to search for backups based on their restore point. If this field is provided, start_time must also be included in the request. Uses a date format with optional timestamp, for example: `2023-01-15` or `2023-01-15T10:30:00Z`.
- `limit` (Number) The maximum number of backups to return. If not set, only the first 500 backups will be returned.
- `sort_order` (String) Specifies the sort direction for the returned results, which are ordered based on the `as_of_time` field. Use `ASC` for ascending or `DESC` for descending order.
- `start_time` (String) Beginning timestamp of the range (inclusive) used to search for backups based on their restore point. If this field is provided, end_time must also be included in the request. Uses a date format with optional timestamp, for example: `2023-01-15` or `2023-01-15T10:30:00Z`.

### Read-Only

- `backups` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--backups))

<a id="nestedatt--backups"></a>
### Nested Schema for `backups`

Read-Only:

- `as_of_time` (String) The point in time (in UTC) the backup restores to.
