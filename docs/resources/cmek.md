# cockroach_cmek (Resource)

Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) resource for a single cluster



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Cluster ID
- `regions` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--regions))

### Optional

- `additional_regions` (Attributes List) Once CMEK is enabled for a cluster, no new regions can be added to the cluster resource, since they need encryption key info stored in the CMEK resource. New regions can be added and maintained here instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--additional_regions))
- `status` (String) Aggregated status of the cluster's encryption key(s)

<a id="nestedatt--regions"></a>
