# cockroach_user_role_grant (Resource)

A role grant for a user. This resource is recommended to be used when a user's roles are managed across multiple terraform projects or in conjunction with console UI granted roles. For authoritative management over a user's roles, use the [user_role_grants](user_role_grants) resource.

 As with all terraform resources, care must be taken to limit management of the same resource to a single project.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "user_id" {
  type = string
}

resource "cockroach_user_role_grant" "admin_grant" {
  user_id = var.user_id
  role = {
    role_name     = "CLUSTER_ADMIN",
    resource_type = "CLUSTER",
    resource_id   = cockroach_cluster.example.id
  }
}
```
