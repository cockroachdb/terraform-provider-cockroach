# cockroach_user_role_grants (Resource)

Manage all the role grants for a user. This resource is authoritative.  If role grants are added elsewhere, for example, via the console UI or another terraform project, using this resource will try to reset them. Use the [cockroach_user_role_grant](user_role_grant) resource for non-authoritative role grants.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "user_id" {
  type = string
}

resource "cockroach_user_role_grants" "cockroach" {
  user_id = var.user_id
  roles = [
    {
      role_name     = "ORG_ADMIN",
      resource_type = "ORGANIZATION",
      resource_id   = ""
    },
    {
      role_name     = "CLUSTER_ADMIN",
      resource_type = "CLUSTER",
      resource_id   = cockroach_cluster.prod.id
    },
    {
      role_name     = "FOLDER_ADMIN",
      resource_type = "FOLDER",
      resource_id   = cockroach_folder.dev.id
    },
  ]
}
```
